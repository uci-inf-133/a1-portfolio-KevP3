--Readme document for *YOUR NAME*, *YOUR_EMAIL@uci.edu*--

A reminder on academic integrity, as described in the syllabus.

In general, the course staff expects that you will look at code and examples from many online resources as part of the assignments, particularly to resolve syntax and understand frameworks. We expect that you'll use other libraries you find, and will even require it in some assignments. These practices are often critical to the work of developers today. The best developers are adept at interpreting the examples they see, customizing them to their specific situation, and citing their sources so they can find them later. We expect you to do the same.

While learning from examples is encouraged, attempting to pass an existing project or example from the web as your own is not allowed. If you ever have a question about what is or is not appropriate, feel free to ask the course staff!

Talking to classmates about class material, assignment requirements, etc. is a great way to verify ideas and get feedback. But this distinctly does *not* permit attempting to pass off someone else’s code as your own. Talking over ideas and approaches is allowed, but the work that you produce and submit must be your own.

1. How many assignment points do you believe you completed (replace the *'s with your numbers)?

10/10
- 1/1 Readme
- 2/2 Basic HTML content
- 1/1 Basic CSS styling
- 1/1 Advanced feature
- 2/2 Responsive layout
- 1/1 Passes validation checks
- 2/2 Embraces spirit of the assignment

2. What (a) basic features, (b) CSS features, and (c) advanced features did you include in your portfolio?

(a) Basic features

At least one image, with descriptive alt attribute(s) 
    (index.html line 37)
Appropriate headings and paragraph text 
    (index.html line 22 or resume.html line 22,37,43,76,106,123 usage of h1, h2, and 3)
Links to external page(s) 
    (index.html line 26 and 28)
Multiple pages, with appropriate navigation between them 
    (navigation between index.html, resume.html, and contactForm.html lines 25, 27, and 29 for all 3 html files)

(b) CSS features

Modifying padding and margins to indent content and enhance readability
    (many padding change like in style.css 59 60) 
Modifying link, text color, or other colors to be visually appealing, perhaps with one of the pallette creators in the resources tab
    (style.css lines 41-48 and 116)

(c) Advanced features

A contact form which leverages HTML forms
    (contactForm.html uses HTML forms to contact my UCI email)


3. Did you ignore any of the warnings or errors presented by the accessibility checker? If so, why does this not seem like an accessibility concern? If it's useful, you can consolidate your thoughts on multiple warnings/errors if the rationale is similar.

Using the Achecker accessibility checker I did not get any known or likely problems in all 3 of my html files
I chose to ignore potential problems because they didn't seem to be an accessibility concern just the checker not understanding what's on the page
For example, with the image of myself, the accessibility checker waas concerned about the alt text even though it can't see the image
Other potential problems were "title may not describe the document" which may be true since I made the title my name because it's a portfolio about members
Another potential problem I thought was an accessibility concern in having 2 heading ones in resume.html I fixed it because in one of my other classes I learned that there should only be one heading one in a page

4. How long, in hours, did it take you to complete this assignment?

40+ hours

5. What online resources did you consult when completing this assignment? (list specific URLs, describe queries to Generative AI, or use of AI-based code completion)

Used https://www.w3schools.com to go through the html and css api
Asked generative AI about how to create (api questions) what I wanted such as using the calc() function in style.css line 8 and what <br> does in contactForm.html line 34
Generative AI assisted coding specifically for resume.html where I first downloaded it as a web.html from google docs 
but it was formatted as one very long line of code so I asked generative AI to turn it into readable code then I tweaked to my liking

6. What classmates or other individuals did you consult as part of this assignment? What did you discuss?

No one

7. Is there anything special we need to know in order to run your code?

No
